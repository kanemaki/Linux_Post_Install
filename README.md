# Linux_Post_Install
Shell Script to automate the installation and configuration of programs.

After repeating this process for two weekends testing 
- Pop!_Os
- Manjaro
- Xubuntu

I decided to create this script that makes my desktop ready for use.

# Use
Change the script execution permission: ```chmod 755 ubuntuScript.sh```

Then run the script: ```./ubuntuScript.sh```
